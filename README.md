Simple Base64 Encoder/Decoder

My first work in python.

This Python script provides a simple command-line interface to perform Base64 encoding and decoding of text. It's a straightforward tool that can be useful for basic encoding and decoding tasks, such as obfuscating data or ensuring safe transfer of data over media that are not binary-safe.

Features
Encoding: Convert plain text to Base64.
Decoding: Convert Base64 encoded text back to plain text.
User-friendly Interface: Easy to use prompts guide you through the process.
Error Handling: Provides error messages for incorrect input or decoding failures.
Requirements
To run this script, you need Python installed on your system. The script is compatible with Python 3.

Usage
Run the script using Python:
bash
python base64_encoder_decoder.py
When prompted, choose your action:

Enter 1 to perform encoding.
Enter 2 to perform decoding.
Enter 0 to exit the program.
If you choose to encode (1), you'll be asked to enter the text you wish to encode.

If you choose to decode (2), you'll be asked to enter the Base64 text you wish to decode.

Follow the prompts to get your encoded or decoded text, or to exit the application.

Example
plaintext
Do you need to encrypt or decrypt? Enter 1 for encryption, 2 for decryption, or 0 to exit: 1
Please enter the content you want to encrypt: Hello World
The encrypted content is: SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=
